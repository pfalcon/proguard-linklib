proguard-linklib - Java linklib generator based on original ProGuard.

The linklib idea is as follows: to compile java code, you only need class
interface/signatures, not the actual code. If you're not interested in
running the code on the same system where you compile code (for example,
if target platform is embedded), and libraries are sizable, and you need
to maintain several concurrent versions of the libs, and need to ship
that all to third-parties in the form of SDK, it makes sense to actually
remove all the code from the .jars, and provide shrinked libs for SDK-like
usage and download.

proguard-linklib implements exactly such code removal, together with other
minimification techniques like removing private members (which can't be
accessed or inherited), see examples/linklib.pro. On top of that,
linklibize-jar is provided, which removes anonymous classes completely,
and tightly packages resulting jar with 7zip.

To assess kind of savings achieved, framework.jar from Android 1.6 was
shrinked from 5418884 to 1681606 bytes, or more than 3-fold reduction in
size.

Please note that so far this should be considered proof of concept, and
requires extensive testing yet.


Below is original README content:

ProGuard, Java class file shrinker, optimizer, obfuscator, and preverifier
==========================================================================

This distribution contains the following directories:

- bin      : simple wrapper scripts to run ProGuard, its GUI, and ReTrace
- lib      : the main jars, compiled and ready to use with "java -jar ...."
- docs     : the complete documentation, licenses, etc. in html format
- examples : some example configuration files
- src      : the source code
- build    : various alternative build scripts


The best place to start is docs/index.html


Example
=======

If you want to give ProGuard a spin right away, try processing the ProGuard
jar itself:

    cd examples
    java -jar ../lib/proguard.jar @proguard.pro

The resulting proguard_out.jar contains the same application, but it's a lot
smaller.

Enjoy!
