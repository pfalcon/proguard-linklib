#
# This ProGuard configuration file illustrates how to create a
# "link library" which is devoid of any code (i.e. as small as
# possible) and essentially contains only method prototypes
# and not suitable for running code, but otherwise perfectly
# suitable for compiling code against (assuming it will be run
# elsewhere where the full library is present).
# Usage:
#     java -jar lib.jar @linklib.pro
#

# Specify the input jars, output jars, and library jars.
# In this case, the input jar is the program library that we want to process.

# If you don't specify all dependencies, you may get lot of warnings.
# It's safe to ignore them - we we will never run resulting jar, and
